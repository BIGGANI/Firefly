# Firefly
Firefly is a PHP based money manager. It's built to support my own finances, but
can be used by pretty much anybody.

## Introduction
Firefly is pretty simple. First and foremost, Firefly can be used to create a
 bunch of accounts. Each account has an opening balance and a date for that
 balance. For example: your balance was EUR 100,- at the start of this year.

Once you have your accounts fixed you can start adding transactions. A
transaction is either money coming in or coming out. It has a description and
 a date as well.

If you do this for a long enough time, you have a pretty useful financial
overview. Firefly can generate charts and reports which you can use to keep
an eye on your finances.
