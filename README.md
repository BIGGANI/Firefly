Firefly
=======

Firefly is a PHP based money manager. It's built to support my own finances, but can be used by pretty much anybody. Instructions and an installation guide will be placed here later, although it is fairly simple to get it running.

Since I have no actual other users (that I know of) apart from myself this isn't really necessary yet.
